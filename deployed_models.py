The remote control repository can be found at https://github.com/adammoss/SunFounder_PiCar-V and is located on your RPi at
/home/pi/SunFounder PiCar-V/remote control. This has been cloned and adapted
from SunFounder for this project by the module conveners. You should not modify
the master branch of this code, as this can cause merge conflicts if we update it. Instead, you will develop an installable package to drive the car using deep learning,
according to the API specifications below, and only set environment variables where
needed.
If major changes are made we will inform you, and these can be merged by
opening a terminal and entering git pull origin master within the repository. If
you would like to add features that you think would be beneficial, this should be done
by submitting a pull request. An example would be an improved UI to manually
control the car. If approved, we can then merge this into the master branch of the
repository and everyone will benefit. '''#
